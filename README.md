## What is Postman?
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is an application that makes it easy to test APIs using an intuitive graphical user interface.  Configure your endpoints, parameters, input files, and other settings by clicking and typing in the interface, and send requests with the click of a button.  Responses appear back in the interface as well, making for a complete, end-to-end, no-code API testing experience.

<br>

## What is a Postman Collection?
Postman supports an easy way to preload API request configurations with "Collections" so you can start sending API Calls without the hassle of setting them up from scratch or referring back to documentation to make sure you're including all the right parameters.  pdfRest has created a Postman Collection, available in the Postman API Network.

<br>

## Getting Started with the pdfRest Postman Collection

1. Find pdfRest in the Postman API Network here: https://www.postman.com/pdfrest/ 
2. To add your API key, go to **Collections** -> **pdfRest API** -> **Authorization**. The authorization **Type** should already be set to *Api Key*, and the **Key** field should read *Api-Key*.
3. In the **Value** field, replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the value of your API key, and click the 'Save' button.
4. Choose any request in the pdfRest collection and go to the request's **Body** tab.
5. Next to the `file` key, click **Select Files** to upload an input file for your request.

## API Documentation
After you've successfully sent an API Call using these examples in Postman, take a look at the [Documentation](https://pdfrest.com/documentation.html) for each API endpoint for a full description of parameters you can adjust to customize your solution.

## API Code Samples
Easily integrate pdfRest with your application by starting from functional [Code Samples](https://github.com/datalogics/pdf-rest-api-samples) with Python, PHP, JavaScript, and cURL.
